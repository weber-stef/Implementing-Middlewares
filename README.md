creating a logger middleware

## Implementing Middlewares

1. Create a logger middleware that logs on every request the following values
    - Request Method (HTTP verb e.g. GET)
    - the route that is requested

## Steps I took
creating repo on github
cloning repo to local machine
npm int to create a package.json
npm install express --save to install express as a dev-dependency of my project
